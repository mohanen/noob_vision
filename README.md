> Over Simplified Vision _Exercises/Experiments/Examples_

Tired of going through hours and hours of tutorials just to get an _idea/recall_ what's going on, well I don't know about you but I am.  

Sometimes it's _easier/better/quicker_ to _learn/recall_ stuff by just getting hands-on with some simple _exercises/experiments/examples_.

You can always drown in details when required, but to start you don't have to.
